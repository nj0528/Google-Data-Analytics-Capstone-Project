# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project

Introduction

This analysis is for the capstone project which is a part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate course.

SCENARIO

Cyclistic is a bike ship program uses bikes that can be unlocked from any station and can be returned to any other station in the system at any time.  Customers who purchase single ride or full day passes are referred to as casual riders and customers who purchase annual membership are considered as Cyclistic members. It has been discovered by Cyclistic financial experts that yearly membership is more lucrative than casual riding.

Objective

My objective create a marketing strategy to convet  casual riders into annual members. I will be analysing Cyclistic’s historical bike trip data to identify trends and to comprehend how annual members and casual riders differ, why the casual riders would buy a membership and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. 

Data 

 I was instructed to use Cyclistic’s historical trip data. I will be using the dataset that was made public by Motivate International Inc, under the license. The data is reliable and authentic. It is comprehensive, current, and cited. I downloaded the data and stored it appropriately on my local computer. I have downloaded data from January 21 – December 21. The data is in CVS format and there are a total of 13 columns. I utilized R to clean and analyze the data as it could process the the data more quickly than Excel. I then visualized the data using Tableau.
